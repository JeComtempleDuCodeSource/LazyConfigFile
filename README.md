# LazyConfigFile
Dumber than .ini \
LazyConfigFileH.hpp is the header only. \
And CMakeLists.txt is for building a library off of it, i don't know why would you use this in the first place and why would you link it as library but it is there...

# Info
Comment ```# COMMENT ``` Works like ```//``` in C \
Syntax: ```Key=Value;``` yes that's all, no sections whatever however spaces are supported. \
C++ Example in the ./Example folder.
